# Doremon puzzle Game.
- For the following project game, I used one of charcter name Doremon cartoon/anime back from my childhood, as the piece of puzzle for the game project. The following project consist use of HTML, CSS and Javascripts in order for the game functions.
- This HTML code represents a game project, which includes a puzzle board and a difficulty selection container. The game's title is "Game Project," and it includes an image of the Doraemon logo.

- The puzzle board consists of eight puzzle blocks that display images numbered 1 to 8. The puzzle blocks are contained in a "puzzle-container" div, which is styled     using an external stylesheet called "styles.css."

- The difficulty selection container is contained in a div with the id "difficulty_container." It consists of three buttons labeled "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard." The -   purpose of these buttons is to allow the user to choose the difficulty level of the puzzle.

- The script.js file is linked to the HTML document, which suggests that it contains the game's functionality. This game is expected to have the user select the -       difficulty level, shuffle the puzzle blocks randomly, and the user then re-arranges the blocks to match the original image.

- first step to process the image was to be divided in to 8 pieces of images and leaving the blank corner to be left empty. for hte rest of the puzzle pieces to be moving.
